# Thesis-CLIP-For-Object-Detection
Thie repository contains all the code for my Bachelors Degree Thesis. 
This project builds on the Contrastive-Language-Image-Pretraining (CLIP) Model. We leverage CLIPs succeptibility to typographical attacks in order to build a robust object detection model for objects containing textual labels on them.
